Toggle the presence of an element

Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by vue

These apply reactive behaviour to the rendered DOM

In the example we wanted to say that evaluate the DOM only if the 'seen' property evaluates to true

We can bind data not only to text and attributes but also to the structure of the DOM
